# TetrisMVP Project

This is a Tetris project built with Java and the Swing GUI library.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

### Objective
The goal is to arrange the falling blocks (Tetrominoes) into complete horizontal lines. When a line is full, it will be cleared, and any blocks above it will fall down.

The game is over when the stack of blocks reaches the top of the board.

### Controls
Use your keyboard to control the falling shape:

* **Move Left:** `A` or `Left Arrow`
* **Move Right:** `D` or `Right Arrow`
* **Rotate:** `W` or `Up Arrow`

*(Note: Hard Drop and Soft Drop are potential features for future implementation. P.S. There's no future implementation)*

### Restarting the Game
When the game ends (the "GAME OVER" screen appears):

* Press the `ENTER` key
* **or** `Left-Click` anywhere on the game window

to start a new game.
